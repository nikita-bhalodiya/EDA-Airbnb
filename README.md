Project Summary

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Airbnb is a service that lets property owners rent out their spaces to travelers looking for a place to stay. Travelers can rent a space for multiple people to share, a shared space with private rooms, or the entire property for themselves.

I have performed data wrangling, handled null values and create two dataset like for both categorical and numerical features. I Analyze data with respect to room_category Vs Price, Analyze data with respect to Avg Minimum Nights vs Neighbourhood / room_category, Analyze data with respect monthly reviews varies with room_category in each neighborhood groups, Analyze data with respect to room availability with neighborhoods, room standards. I can conclude that Manhattan have highest price booking and second highest price booking is Brooklyn followed by Staten Island and All three type of room highest price is for Entire_home or apt for almost all neighborhoods. Entire home/apt have highest price and Shared room have lowest price and have highest avg minimum night stay restriction. Brooklyn and Manhattan stands pretty fall in terms of review rate per month. A particular room type of a particular price range can be available throughout year.
